## Architecture

The core architecture of LogVerse is structured as follows:

1. **Log Collection**: A Kafka Producer collects log data from various services and applications, storing it in Kafka Brokers.
2. **Stream Processing**: Apache Flink processes log data from Kafka in real-time, performing anomaly detection and data transformation.
3. **Data Storage**: Flink stores processed data in databases such as Cassandra or MongoDB, enabling fast retrieval and analysis.
4. **Backup**: Periodically backs up log data to HDFS, ensuring data can be recovered in case of failure.
5. **Alerting System**: Sends real-time alerts to users when predefined thresholds are exceeded or critical events occur.
